                <h2>Forest</h2>
                <p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world,
                     incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function.
                     The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares 
                     with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. 
                     It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use."Using this definition, Global Forest 
                     Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square 
                     kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020.[6]</p>
            <h3>subsection</h3>
              <p> More than half of the world's forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, Russia, and the United States).

            <p>Forests at different latitudes and elevations, and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration
                 form distinctly different biomes: boreal forests around the North Pole, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests 
                 around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes.
                 Areas at higher elevations tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and the amount of precipitation also affects forest composition. </p>
            <h3>Another subsection</h3>
            <p>Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.
                 Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of biomass per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.

                <pre>A forest is an area of land where various plants and animals grow naturally 
                due to various climatic conditions. 
                Depending on the unique characteristics, 
                there are various types of forests like mangrove forests, tropical rainforests, etc.</pre>
